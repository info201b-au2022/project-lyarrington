In the last two and a half decade, China's citizen population grew by as much as 73% from 1997 to 2017. In that same time, the country’s GDP grew by an astounding 1078% and with that, the number of vehicles in China grew by 335% in merely two and a half decades. This without a doubt contributed to the infamously poor air quality in China.
Exposure to air pollution, according to Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, can be from a series of fronts such as vehicle exhaust, gas-fueled yard equipment, and industrial emissions. The citizens of China are direct stakeholders of this study, as they are subjected to these living conditions on a daily basis. When one breathes in particles, especially large particles, one is at an increased risk of a series of health concerns from coughs to itchy eyes, leading up to difficulty to breathe and lung diseases, and may result in conditions as serious as cancer or even death. As seen from out report, in the year 2013, more than an average of 65% of days, and as much as 85% of days in the city of Shanghai, was considered to have air qualities categorized at “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” or worse in all four major cities. This poses a major health risk to all the citizens of China.
Thankfully, as this study have uncovered, this trend has since moderately improved since 2013. Between the year 2020 and 2021, the four cities’ average number of days in “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” or worse dropped to an average of 40%, with Beijing, the country’s capital, taking the lead with only 20% of days considered “Unhealthy” and practically no days considered “Very Unhealthy”. While this is still far from a healthy environment, the residents of China can take comfort in the progress that has been made since and can hopefully look to a healthier future.  
On the other hand, this study’s result also testifies for the Chinese government. As a member of the study’s indirect stakeholder, the Chinese government proposed a five year action plan in September of 2013, in order to reduce the presence of PM¬2.5 in the air. This plan involved a series of actions such as limiting emissions standards, incentivized the purchase of private electric vehicles, and so forth. The results of this study revealed that the government actions must be inversely correlated with AQI measurements, suggesting that the Chinese government should benefit from the study’s result and gain more trust from its citizens for their efficiency and their part in bettering the air quality.
