Note: Introduction needs a picture, so we can use the picture in the project proposal.

As the world has grown and developed, numerous unforeseen consequences have come up. One such issue is air pollution. Due to unsustainable practices in 
manufacturing and across other industries, the air we are breathing is continuously becoming more and more unsafe. As the top manufacturing country in the 
world, China has remained one of the largest contributors to this problem. Their citizens are suffering the consequences: many experience breathing 
problems, some worsening into chronic respiratory diseases and even death. Faced with backlash from the international community, China has taken major 
steps towards reversing these changes by implementing programs and changes in their industries. We decided to analyze the top four polluting cities in 
China (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenyang) to find potential trends in their industries and air pollution and verify if their programs have been 
successful. Our goal was to identify which industries would potentially pollute the air the most. We had three major questions:
1. How has air quality changed over the past decade in each city?
2. What are the top industries of each of the four cities?
3. Which industries contributed the most to polluting the air?
To answer these questions, we first analyzed air pollution trends in these four cities. We used data collected by each city’s United States embassy over 
the past decade. The results of this analysis were used along with information about each city’s top industries and manufacturing outputs to determine 
which industries were most detrimental to the environment. Our findings revealed that the chemical industry contributed significantly more to air pollution
than the automotive industry because the only city that experienced worsening air quality was the city that housed major chemical plants (Beijing), while 
the other cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenyang), which all depended heavily on the automotive industry, saw improved air quality.
